Hello Python Learners,

I created this repository for scripts utilized as part of a new learning resouce for Python this time via Udemy 100 Day Bootcamp

I have been trying to learn Python for some time now usually walking away when I get stumped adn no where to turn for help. I started learning Pyhton at the Univ of Mich via Coursera.org. The first course wasn't too bad, however, there where times I was confused and searched the web for help. Last summer I cheecked out Codecademy, initially it had a different approach to start out learning so I signed up for a full year subscription. The main problem with it was a continuous connection issues which made learning disfunctioning and the help forums were a bit outdated. I recently started working with JetBrains, I really liked there teaching format except when I needed to review my completed work or past topics... not a simple task, plus you are paying money. I don't mine paying it's that I wasn't sure the rate quoted was only for the next month or every month until I cancel. I believe I will go back and continue learning with JetBrains there IDE Pycharm/Pycharm Edu is awesome; by comparison working with Anaconda can be a bit overwhelming to install and get going, but it works especially the Jupyter notes.

Recently, I answered an Udemy prompt in an email and I'm learning with Instructor Dr. Angela Yu, a Developer and Lead Instructor who has put together a 100 Day BootCamp course, so far it's pretty good.
